## [Unreleased] — 2026-09-01 audit fixes

Bugs that changed results (re-run affected sweeps):
- `fundus_utils.make_rng`: persistent DataLoader workers replayed the identical augmentation every epoch (≈`num_workers` variants per image for the whole run). Every `train_idrid.py` result with `--num-workers > 0` predates this fix.
- `model_seg.DecoderBlock`: GCG and `--no-gcg` arms now share bit-identical non-gate initialisation at the same seed (the gate used to consume RNG before the fuse convs).
- `run_experiment.py` / `run_arch_sweep.py`: `--eval-tiled-val` is passed through (default on with tiled eval + patches), so checkpoint selection sees native-resolution microaneurysms.
- `run_kd_xfer.sh`: a partially trained teacher is no longer "reused"; completion is tracked by a `.done` marker.
- `train_mbrset.py`: AdaBN-adapted weights are saved (`model_bnadapt`); zero-BN backbones no longer report a fake adapted number; batch-size-1 crash in adaptation fixed; results JSON written before adaptation; GCG requested with a timm backbone is an error instead of a silent no-op; `--amp` on MPS uses bf16.

Deployment claims:
- `export_coreml.py`: `--bn-stats {source,adapted}`, per-compute-unit benchmark (CPU_AND_NE vs ALL vs CPU), `--warmup`/`--runs` matching the documented protocol, real-image verification with pass/fail (`--verify-images`), preprocessing spec in model metadata.
- `evaluate_deploy.py`: median latency, CPU-proxy latency key qualified, `image_ext` honoured.

Environment / repo:
- Python range stated and enforced (`pyproject.toml`, `check_env.py`): 3.9–3.13.
- `requirements.txt`: per-version numpy markers; coremltools macOS-only.
- Dockerfile / `setup_remote.sh`: CUDA index `cu126` (cu121 has no torch 2.8.0).
- `.dockerignore` mirrors `.gitignore` (no more 8 GB `data/` in the build context).
- GitHub Actions: CPU test suite on every push.
- `LICENSE` (MIT, code only), `reproduce.sh`, `Makefile`, this changelog.
- Untracked `.DS_Store`, `exp_s34.out`, `artifact_samples/`; removed empty `summary.md`; moved `train.py`, `train_seg.py`, `seg_dataset.py`, root `test_*.py` to `legacy/`.

## 2026-08-31 — REPORT.md
- 5-seed V4-Small@384 distillation + AdaBN results; Core ML export and clinical operating point (see REPORT.md).

## 2026-08-20 — codebase audit
- FGADR partition fixed at `split_seed=42`; DDP eval padding; gating read from checkpoints; INT8 calibration selected on val; single imbalance correction; full-frame eval resize; bf16 on MPS; NaN Dice for absent lesions. Pre-fix FGADR numbers are not comparable.
